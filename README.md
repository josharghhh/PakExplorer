# Pak Explorer

A simple GUI application for opening/viewing/extracting Arma Reforger's PAC1 file format.

## Quick download
Grab the latest portable build from the GitHub Releases page:

## Web version
This project is a Windows desktop (WPF) application and does not run inside a browser. If you'd like a browser-based version, we'd need to build a separate web client (for example, a WebAssembly or server-backed extractor) with different packaging and security constraints.
